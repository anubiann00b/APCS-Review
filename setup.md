# Getting Set Up!

The first thing we need to do is get our machine ready to run Java. You can download Java [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). I strongly suggest you get the JDK + NetBeans version, which includes the NetBeans IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Once you get Java installed, open up a terminal and type in `javac -version`. You should see something like this:

    javac version "1.7.0_25"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_25-b17)

This means you successfully installed Java on your machine. Good for you!

If you have not already installed NetBeans, you should do so now. I suggest the Java SE version [here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/).

You can also use a different IDE such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) or [jGRASP](http://www.jgrasp.org/). jGRASP isn't much of an IDE, it's more of a text editor and compiler thrown together.

If you decide to use Eclipse, keep in mind that this tutorial may be oriented around NetBeans.

If you decide to use jGRASP, then you will miss out on all the benefits of an IDE. Like syntax highlighting. And autocompletion. Choose an IDE.
