APCS Review
===========

A guide to review for the AP Computer Science test.

This guide is meant for self-study, but you can use it to supplement your APCS class.

Each article will go over the minimum requirements for the class and then go into more detail about the subject.

There may also be articles that go beyond the scope of APCS and into advanced Java, or even into Git.

This project was started at the time of the 2014 AP tests, but hopefully it will help people next year.
