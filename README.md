APCS-Review
===========

A guide to review for the AP Computer Science test.

This guide is meant for self-study, but you can use it to supplement your APCS class.

Each article will go over the minimum requirements for the class and then go into more detail about the subject.

This project was started on May 1, 5 days from this year's APCS test. However, I still am going to start this to hopefully help future APCS students as well.
